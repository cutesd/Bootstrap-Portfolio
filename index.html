                Well, let's see ... I've been coding since High School.  My first foray into coding was a C++ class my sophmore year.  
                I don't think I got my head fully wrapped around OOP that year but I really enjoyed the class and it was the only AP Exam I got a 4 on and I didn't study for it.  So, yes, I loved coding.
                </p> 
                <p>Cut to a couple years later, the year was 2000, I had just graduated, and I got hired as an office assistant for an unknown LLC.  Turned out they wanted to build early education content for kids on the web.  I started out shelving antique books in the basement.  One day the owner said he wanted me to scan in some images and edit them in Photoshop.  He showed me what to do and I did it.  He liked what I did so he asked me to make some tiled background images.  He showed me what to do ... I did it.  Then he had his son come in and teach me some HTML.  He thought I did alright so he said, "I'll teach you how to make animated gifs".  So I did that. </p>
                <p>Then he said, "Make 10 of these and you'll be a graphic designer."  I thought he was joking ... but sure enough, 6 months later he hired me on as a graphic designer.  
                <p>
                So anyway, that's my humble beginnings.  I'm gonna stop now because that should be enough text for this page.
